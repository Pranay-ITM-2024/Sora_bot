💰 ECONOMY SYSTEM - COMPLETE GUIDE
===========================================

Complete explanation of the economy system
including wallet, bank, loans, and earnings.

===========================================
💵 WALLET SYSTEM
===========================================

WHAT IS IT?
Your wallet holds "active" coins that you can
spend immediately on purchases, bets, and heists.

HOW TO CHECK:
Command: /balance or /bal
Shows: Wallet + Bank balance

CHARACTERISTICS:
✅ Instant access to funds
✅ Use for all transactions
✅ Visible to other players
✅ Can be lost in heist penalties
❌ No interest earned
❌ Not protected from losses

EXAMPLE:
User types: /balance
Bot shows:
💰 Wallet: 5,250 coins
🏦 Bank: 15,000 coins
💵 Total: 20,250 coins

===========================================
🏦 BANK SYSTEM
===========================================

WHAT IS IT?
Safe storage for coins that earns interest
over time. Protected from some penalties.

INTEREST RATE: 0.5% per 24 hours

HOW IT WORKS:
1. Deposit coins from wallet to bank
2. Every 24 hours, interest auto-calculates
3. Interest added directly to bank
4. Compounds over time (interest on interest)

COMMANDS:
/deposit <amount> - Move wallet → bank
/withdraw <amount> - Move bank → wallet

EXAMPLES:

Example 1: Simple Deposit
Wallet: 10,000 coins
Command: /deposit 8000
Result:
  Wallet: 2,000 coins
  Bank: 8,000 coins

Example 2: Interest Earning
Day 1: Bank = 10,000 coins
Day 2: Bank = 10,050 coins (+50 interest)
Day 3: Bank = 10,100.25 coins (+50.25 interest)
Day 4: Bank = 10,150.75 coins (+50.50 interest)

After 30 days: 10,000 → 10,151 coins
After 1 year: 10,000 → 18,431 coins

Example 3: Compound Growth
Starting: 50,000 in bank
After 7 days: 50,175 (+175)
After 30 days: 50,756 (+756)
After 90 days: 52,283 (+2,283)
After 365 days: 92,155 (+42,155!)

STRATEGIES:
1. Keep 20% in wallet for daily use
2. Deposit 80% for interest growth
3. Withdraw only when needed
4. Long-term growth beats gambling
5. Compound interest = passive income

===========================================
💳 LOAN SYSTEM
===========================================

WHAT ARE LOANS?
Borrow coins now, pay back with interest
over time through EMI (installments).

COMMAND: /takeloan <amount>

HOW IT WORKS:
1. Request loan amount
2. System calculates:
   - Interest rate (10%)
   - Total repayment amount
   - EMI (weekly payment)
   - Number of payments
3. Approve and get coins instantly
4. Pay back with /payloan

LOAN TERMS:
Loan Amount: 1,000 - 1,000,000 coins
Interest Rate: 10% total
Payment Period: 4 weeks (4 EMIs)
EMI: Total amount ÷ 4

EXAMPLES:

Example 1: Small Loan
Loan: 10,000 coins
Interest: 1,000 (10%)
Total owed: 11,000 coins
EMI: 2,750 coins/week
Duration: 4 weeks

Week 1: /payloan → Pay 2,750
Week 2: /payloan → Pay 2,750
Week 3: /payloan → Pay 2,750
Week 4: /payloan → Pay 2,750
Total paid: 11,000 coins

Example 2: Large Loan
Loan: 100,000 coins
Interest: 10,000 (10%)
Total owed: 110,000 coins
EMI: 27,500 coins/week
Duration: 4 weeks

Example 3: Early Payoff
Loan: 50,000 coins
Total owed: 55,000 coins
After 1 week: Outstanding = 41,250

You pay full amount: /payloan 41250
Loan cleared! Save interest!

Example 4: Overpayment Protection
Outstanding: 5,000 coins
You try to pay: 10,000 coins
System charges: 5,000 only
Refunds: 5,000 (not charged)
Message: "Overpayment Refunded"

PENALTIES:
Missed payment: +5% penalty
Example: Miss EMI of 2,750
New amount: 2,750 + 137.5 = 2,887.5

LOAN STRATEGY:
✅ GOOD uses:
- Buy essential heist gear
- Emergency casino gear purchase
- Market opportunity (buy low)
- Multiplayer heist entry

❌ BAD uses:
- Gambling in casino
- Risky solo heists
- Impulse purchases
- Already have debt

PAYING BACK:
Command: /payloan [amount]
No amount = pays EMI
Custom amount = pays that much

Tips:
1. Pay more than EMI to finish early
2. Pay from wallet first, then bank
3. Can't overpay (auto-refunds excess)
4. Check with /loaninfo
