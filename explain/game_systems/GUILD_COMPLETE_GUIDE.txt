a common bank account, earn interest together,
and coordinate for mutual benefit.

BENEFITS:
✅ Shared guild bank with interest
✅ Interest distributed by contribution
✅ Teamwork and coordination
✅ Social connections
✅ Multiplayer heist teams
✅ Passive income from contributions

LIMITATIONS:
❌ Server-specific (can't cross servers)
❌ No guild vs guild features (yet)
❌ Leader controls most decisions

===========================================
🎯 GUILD COMMANDS
===========================================

/guild - View guild menu and options
/guild create <name> - Create new guild
/guild join <name> - Join existing guild
/guild leave - Leave current guild
/guild info - View guild statistics
/guild_deposit <amount> - Add coins to guild bank

- No special characters

PROCESS:

You are the Leader.
Members: 1 (you)
Guild Bank: 0 coins

Example 2: Failed Creation (already in guild)

Command: /guild create Champions
Result: ❌ You're already in a guild!
Must leave current guild first.

Example 3: Failed Creation (name taken)

===========================================

===========================================
📤 LEAVING A GUILD
===========================================

💰 GUILD BANK SYSTEM
===========================================

HOW IT WORKS:

- Earns 0.5% interest per 24 hours
- Interest distributed by contribution %
- Members deposit/withdraw freely
- Contributions tracked individually

GUILD INFO:
Command: /guild info

- Guild bank balance
- Daily interest amount
- Your contribution
- Your share %

EXAMPLE GUILD INFO:

💰 Guild Bank: 500,000 coins
📈 Daily Interest: 2,500 coins
🎯 Your Contribution: 80,000 coins (16%)
💵 Your Daily Cut: 400 coins

===========================================
📥 DEPOSITING TO GUILD BANK
===========================================

COMMAND: /guild_deposit <amount>

HOW IT WORKS:
1. Amount taken from your wallet
2. Added to guild bank
3. Your contribution increases
4. Your share % updates
5. Future interest reflects new share

EXAMPLES:

Example 1: First Deposit
Guild Bank: 100,000 coins
Your contribution: 0 (0%)
Command: /guild_deposit 20000

Result:
Guild Bank: 120,000 coins (+20,000)

Result:
Guild Bank: 150,000 coins (+30,000)
Your contribution: 50,000 (33.33%)
Your daily interest: 500 coins

Example 3: Insufficient Funds
Wallet: 5,000 coins
Command: /guild_deposit 10000
Result: ❌ Insufficient funds!
You need 10,000 but have only 5,000

===========================================
📤 WITHDRAWING FROM GUILD BANK
===========================================

COMMAND: /guild_withdraw <amount>

HOW IT WORKS:
1. Amount removed from guild bank
2. Added to your wallet
3. Your contribution decreases proportionally
4. Your share % updates
5. Future interest reflects new share

OVERPAYMENT PROTECTION:
If you withdraw more than you contributed,
system only lets you take your contribution amount.

EXAMPLES:

Example 1: Partial Withdrawal
Guild Bank: 150,000 coins
Your contribution: 50,000 (33.33%)
Command: /guild_withdraw 20000

Result:
Guild Bank: 130,000 coins (-20,000)
Your contribution: 30,000 (23.08%)
Wallet: +20,000 coins

Example 2: Full Withdrawal
Guild Bank: 150,000 coins
Your contribution: 50,000 (33.33%)
Command: /guild_withdraw 50000

Result:
Guild Bank: 100,000 coins (-50,000)
Your contribution: 0 (0%)
Wallet: +50,000 coins
No more interest share!

Example 3: Over-Withdrawal Attempt
Guild Bank: 150,000 coins
Your contribution: 20,000
Command: /guild_withdraw 50000

Result:
❌ You can only withdraw up to 20,000 coins
(your contribution amount)

===========================================
💵 GUILD INTEREST SYSTEM
===========================================

INTEREST RATE: 0.5% per 24 hours

HOW IT'S CALCULATED:
1. Guild bank balance × 0.005 = Total interest
2. Each member gets: Total × (Their % share)
3. Payout goes directly to member's wallet
4. Automatic every 24 hours

CONTRIBUTION SHARE:
Your % = Your contribution ÷ Total guild bank × 100

EXAMPLES:

Example 1: Simple Split

GUILD BANK: 100,000 coins

CONTRIBUTIONS:
Leader: 60,000 (60%)
Member1: 30,000 (30%)
Member2: 10,000 (10%)

DAILY INTEREST: 500 coins

PAYOUT:
Leader: 300 coins (60%)

Member2: 50 coins (10%)

MONTHLY EARNINGS:

Member1: 4,500 coins
Member2: 1,500 coins

Example 2: Growing Guild

DAY 1:
Guild Bank: 50,000
Leader contribution: 50,000 (100%)

Leader gets: 250 coins
Member gets: 126 coins

DAY 30:

===========================================
💡 GUILD STRATEGIES
===========================================

STRATEGY 1: "Equal Partners"
All members contribute equally
Example: 5 members × 20,000 = 100,000 bank
Everyone gets equal interest (20% each)
Fair and democratic

STRATEGY 2: "Leader Heavy"
Leader contributes 60-70%
Members contribute 10-15% each
Leader gets most interest
Good for established players helping newcomers

STRATEGY 3: "Slow Build"
Start small (everyone deposits 5k)
Guild bank: 25,000 (5 members)
Each week, everyone adds 5k more
Grows together over time

STRATEGY 4: "Investment Club"
Target: 1,000,000 guild bank
Members compete to increase share
Highest contributor gets leadership
Drives growth through competition

STRATEGY 5: "Heist Fund"
Guild bank used for team heists
Profits split and redeposited
Compound growth through heisting

===========================================
🎯 GUILD BEST PRACTICES
===========================================

FOR LEADERS:
1. Lead by example (contribute most)
2. Don't withdraw selfishly
3. Organize heist teams
4. Welcome new members
5. Transfer ownership if inactive

FOR MEMBERS:
1. Contribute regularly
2. Don't withdraw unless needed
3. Participate in heists
4. Communicate with team

FOR EVERYONE:
1. Guild bank > personal bank (higher social trust)
2. Contribute = compound interest
3. Coordinate heists with guild
4. Use voice chat for planning
5. Celebrate milestones together

===========================================
📈 GUILD GROWTH EXAMPLES
===========================================

Example 1: "Legends Guild" - Month 1

Week 1:
5 members join, each deposits 10,000
Guild Bank: 50,000
Daily interest: 250 coins

Week 2:
Everyone deposits another 10,000
Guild Bank: 102,500 (50k + 10k×5 + interest)
Daily interest: 512 coins

Week 3:
Everyone deposits 10,000 again
Guild Bank: 156,584
Daily interest: 782 coins

Week 4:
Everyone deposits 10,000 final time
Guild Bank: 212,052
Daily interest: 1,060 coins

Month 1 Total: 212,052 coins
Each member's contribution: 40,000
Each member's share: 20%
Each member's daily passive: 212 coins

Example 2: "Warriors Guild" - Month 3

Starting (Month 1): 200,000 guild bank
Month 2: 420,000 (members kept contributing)
Month 3: 680,000 (compound interest + deposits)

Leader contribution: 280,000 (41%)
Daily interest: 3,400
Leader's cut: 1,394 coins/day
Leader's monthly: ~41,820 coins

That's MORE than original contribution in passive income!

💡 GUILD PRO TIPS
===========================================

1. EARLY CONTRIBUTION = COMPOUND GAINS
   Deposit early, let it grow
   Your 50k today = 92k in 1 year

2. DON'T WITHDRAW FRIVOLOUSLY
   Every withdrawal reduces future interest
   Only withdraw for essential purchases

3. COORDINATE HEISTS
   Guild members = best heist teammates
   Share rewards, redeposit profits

4. RECRUIT ACTIVELY
   More members = more contributions
   More contributions = more interest

5. SET GUILD GOALS
   "Let's hit 100k bank this month"
   "Everyone deposit 5k weekly"
   Goals drive engagement

6. COMMUNICATION IS KEY
   Discord server for guild
   Plan heists together
   Celebrate wins

7. FAIR LEADERSHIP
   Don't hoard all interest
   Share opportunities
   Transfer if going inactive

8. PATIENCE PAYS
   Guild bank = long-term investment
   Compound interest = exponential growth
   Stick with it!

===========================================
📊 GUILD MATH
===========================================

INTEREST CALCULATION:
Daily = Bank × 0.005
Monthly = Bank × 0.15 (approx)
Yearly = Bank × 1.8431 (84.31% APY)

CONTRIBUTION VALUE:
Your 10,000 contribution = 50 coins/day
Your 50,000 contribution = 250 coins/day
Your 100,000 contribution = 500 coins/day

BREAK-EVEN:
100,000 contribution = 500/day
After 200 days: 100,000 coins earned back
After that: Pure profit!

COMPOUND GUILD:
Year 1: 100,000 → 184,310
Year 2: 184,310 → 339,670
Year 3: 339,670 → 626,070
