🃏 BLACKJACK GAME EXPLAINED
===========================================

COMMAND: /blackjack <bet_amount>

HOW IT WORKS:
1. You and dealer each get 2 cards
2. Goal: Get closer to 21 than dealer (without going over)
3. Choose to HIT (take card), STAND (keep hand), or DOUBLE DOWN
4. Dealer hits on 16 or less, stands on 17+
5. Closest to 21 wins!

CARD VALUES:
Number cards (2-10) → Face value
Jack, Queen, King → 10
Ace → 1 or 11 (whichever is better)

ACTIONS:
HIT - Take another card
STAND - Keep your current hand
DOUBLE DOWN - Double your bet, get exactly 1 more card, turn ends

PAYOUTS:
Win: 1:1 (bet $100, win $100)
Blackjack (A + 10-value card): 3:2 (bet $100, win $150)
Push (tie): Get bet back
Bust (over 21): Lose bet
Dealer busts: You win

EXAMPLES:

Example 1: Simple Win
You bet: 500 coins
Your cards: K♠ 7♥ (total: 17)
Dealer shows: 6♦
You: STAND (17 is decent)
Dealer reveals: 6♦ 9♣ (15) → Hits → 10♠ (25 - BUST!)
Result: Dealer busts, you WIN
Payout: 500 + 500 = 1,000 coins

Example 2: Blackjack!
You bet: 1,000 coins
Your cards: A♠ K♦ (BLACKJACK! = 21)
Dealer shows: 8♥
Dealer reveals: 8♥ 9♣ (17)
Result: BLACKJACK WINS!
Payout: 1,000 + 1,500 = 2,500 coins

Example 3: Double Down Success
You bet: 200 coins
Your cards: 5♠ 6♥ (total: 11)
Dealer shows: 6♦
You: DOUBLE DOWN (good odds with 11)
New bet: 400 coins (doubled)
New card: 9♠ (total: 20)
Dealer reveals: 6♦ 10♣ (16) → Hits → 8♠ (24 - BUST!)
Result: You WIN with double bet
Payout: 400 + 400 = 800 coins

Example 4: Push (Tie)
You bet: 300 coins
Your cards: 10♠ 8♥ (18)
You: STAND
Dealer: 10♦ 8♣ (18)
Result: PUSH (tie)
Payout: 300 coins (bet returned)

Example 5: Bust (Loss)
You bet: 500 coins
Your cards: 10♠ 7♥ (17)
Dealer shows: K♦
You: HIT (trying to beat dealer)
New card: 8♠ (total: 25 - BUST!)
Result: You LOSE (went over 21)
Loss: -500 coins

STRATEGY GUIDE:

WHEN TO HIT:
- You have 11 or less (can't bust)
- You have 12-16 and dealer shows 7-Ace
- Soft hands (with Ace) under 18

WHEN TO STAND:
- You have 17 or higher (hard total)
- You have 12-16 and dealer shows 2-6 (dealer likely to bust)
- Dealer showing weak card (4, 5, 6)

WHEN TO DOUBLE DOWN:
- You have 10 or 11 (good odds to get 20/21)
- You have soft 16-18 and dealer shows 4-6
- Never double on hard 12+ (too risky)

DEALER PATTERNS:
Dealer shows 2-6 → WEAK (likely to bust) → Stand on 12+
Dealer shows 7-Ace → STRONG (likely good hand) → Hit until 17+

GEAR BONUSES:
Card Counter (shop item):
- Shows hint about dealer's hidden card
- Example: "Dealer likely has high card" or "Dealer has low card"

Lucky Charm:
- Slightly better card draws
- Small edge over house

ADVANCED TIPS:
1. Basic strategy reduces house edge to ~0.5%
2. Never take insurance (bad odds)
3. Split aces and 8s (if feature added)
4. Never split 10s or face cards
5. Dealer has 30% bust rate with 4, 5, or 6 showing
6. Blackjack (A+10) only on first 2 cards
