💡 STRATEGY TIPS
===========================================

FOR MULTIPLAYER:
1. Communicate with team before starting
2. Assign roles based on skill
3. Buy gear before heist begins
4. Practice minigames with solo heists
5. Driver role is hardest - assign carefully

FOR SOLO:
1. Match approach to your gear
2. Stealth = safest option
3. Use consumables (potions) for bonuses
4. Start small, build up to bigger heists
5. Check detection % before committing

GENERAL:
- Heist during off-peak for focus
- Use /profile to track success rate
- Failed heists still count as experience
- Gear is reusable (one-time purchase)
- Higher target = higher risk

===========================================

===========================================
❓ COMMON QUESTIONS
===========================================

Q: Can I retry a failed minigame?
A: No, one failure = entire heist fails

Q: Do minigames change?
A: Yes, they're randomized each time

Q: Can I leave a heist midway?
A: Only before accepting invitation

Q: What happens if I timeout?
A: Timeout = failure = heist ends
