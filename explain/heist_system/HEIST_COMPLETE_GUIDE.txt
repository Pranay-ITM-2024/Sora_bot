🥷 SOLO HEIST COMPLETE GUIDE
===========================================

COMMAND: /soloheist

HOW IT WORKS:
1. Choose target amount (what you want to steal)
2. Select approach: Stealth, Fast, or Tech
3. Complete 3 phases with minigames
4. Success = get money, Failure = 30% penalty

APPROACHES:

🤫 STEALTH APPROACH
Minigame: Pattern Recognition
How: Remember and type emoji pattern
Example: Bot shows "🔴 🔵 🟢 🟡"
You type: 🔴 🔵 🟢 🟡 (copy-paste allowed)
Noise: LOW (10-20%)
Progress per phase: 30-35%
Best for: Safety, high success rate

💨 FAST APPROACH
Minigame: Reaction Speed
How: Press correct button quickly
Example: 4 buttons appear: LEFT, MIDDLE, RIGHT, STOP
Bot says: "Press RIGHT!"
You have: 8 seconds to click
Noise: HIGH (30-50%)
Progress per phase: 40-50%
Best for: Quick big scores

🛠️ TECH APPROACH
Minigame: Random (Hacking OR Lockpicking)
Hacking: Solve math "12 + 8 + 3 = ?"
Lockpicking: Guess 3-digit combo with hints
Noise: MODERATE (20-30%)
Progress per phase: 35-40%
Best for: Balanced gameplay

PHASE SYSTEM:
Phase 1: ENTRY (0% → ~35%)
Phase 2: VAULT BREACH (~35% → ~70%)
Phase 3: ESCAPE (~70% → 100%)

SUCCESS = Transfer money to wallet!
FAILURE = Pay 30% penalty from wallet/bank

Progress: 68%, Noise: 24%

Phase 3: Pattern "🎯 🎰 🎪"
You: 🎯 🎰 🎪 ✅

SOLO HEIST STRATEGY:
1. Start with Stealth (highest success rate)
2. Buy gear before attempting big heists

4. Target = 2-3x your current balance max
5. Practice minigames with small targets first
6. Fast approach = high risk, high reward
7. Tech approach = balanced, unpredictable
