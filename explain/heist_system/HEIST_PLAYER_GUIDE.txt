                        🎯 WHAT IS A HEIST?
================================================================================

A HEIST is a high-stakes guild-vs-guild bank robbery where you attempt to 
steal coins from another guild's bank! It's an interactive, skill-based 
minigame system that requires quick thinking, coordination, and the right 
equipment.

KEY FEATURES:
• Interactive Minigames - Each phase has unique challenges
• Multiplayer or Solo - Go alone or bring a team (2-5 players)
• High Rewards - Successfully steal up to 75% of a guild's bank
• Real Consequences - Failure means penalties paid to the target guild
• Gear System - Buy equipment to improve your odds

================================================================================
                      ⏰ WHEN CAN YOU HEIST?
================================================================================

SUNDAYS ONLY!
Heists can ONLY be performed on Sundays (UTC timezone).

WHY SUNDAYS?
• On Saturday midnight, all guild members automatically contribute 75% of 
  their total wealth to the guild bank
• This creates high-value targets with lots of coins
• Sunday is "heist day" when guilds can raid each other

COOLDOWN:
• Each guild can only do ONE heist per Sunday
• After your guild completes a heist (success or fail), you must wait until 
  next Sunday
• The cooldown is per guild, not per player

================================================================================
                    👑 WHO CAN START HEISTS?
================================================================================

GUILD LEADERS ONLY!
Only your guild owner/leader can initiate heists using the /heist command.

WHY?
• Prevents spam and trolling
• Ensures strategic decision-making
• Leader chooses targets and team composition
• Protects guild resources

WHAT IF I'M NOT THE LEADER?
• You can still participate if your leader selects you for a multiplayer heist
• Ask your guild leader to organize heist events
• Work on improving your skills and buying heist gear

================================================================================
                        🎮 HEIST MODES
================================================================================

There are TWO ways to execute a heist:

┌─────────────┬─────────┬────────────┬─────────┬──────────────────┐
│ Mode        │ Players │ Difficulty │ Rewards │ Best For         │
├─────────────┼─────────┼────────────┼─────────┼──────────────────┤
│ Solo        │ 1       │ Easier     │ Lower   │ Quick runs, solo │
│ Multiplayer │ 2-5     │ Harder     │ Higher  │ Big scores, team │
└─────────────┴─────────┴────────────┴─────────┴──────────────────┘

SOLO HEIST:
✅ You control everything
✅ Simpler coordination
✅ All rewards to you
❌ No team bonuses
❌ Smaller steals recommended

MULTIPLAYER HEIST:
✅ Team bonuses stack (60% effectiveness)
✅ Role specialization
✅ Can attempt bigger heists
❌ One person fails = everyone fails
❌ Requires coordination

================================================================================
                      🥷 SOLO HEIST GUIDE
================================================================================

STARTING A SOLO HEIST:

1. Use the command (Guild leader only):
   /heist target_guild:EnemyGuild amount:10000
   
   • target_guild = Guild you want to rob
   • amount = How much to steal (0 = auto 50%, max 75% of their bank)

2. Review the preview:
   • See target bank balance
   • Check difficulty level (🟢 Easy / 🟡 Medium / 🔴 Hard)
   • View your gear bonuses
   • Understand penalties if you fail

3. Click "Solo Heist" button

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE THREE PHASES:

Every heist has 3 phases you must complete:

Phase 1: 🚪 ENTRY - Break into the building and bypass initial security
Phase 2: 🔓 VAULT BREACH - Open the vault and access the money
Phase 3: 🏃 ESCAPE - Get away clean without getting caught!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THREE APPROACH STYLES:

Each phase, you choose HOW to proceed:

┌──────────┬─────────────────────┬──────────────────────────┐
│ Approach │ Best For            │ Risk Level               │
├──────────┼─────────────────────┼──────────────────────────┤
│ Stealth  │ Avoiding detection  │ Low noise, steady pace   │
│ Fast     │ Quick completion    │ High noise, fast finish  │
│ Tech     │ Balanced approach   │ Medium noise, good pace  │
└──────────┴─────────────────────┴──────────────────────────┘

IMPORTANT: Each approach has a unique minigame you must complete!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE NOISE METER:

• Every action generates NOISE 🔊
• Higher noise = higher detection chance
• If you get detected = INSTANT FAIL! 🚨
• Noise carries over between phases
• Stealth gear reduces noise generation

STRATEGY TIP: Mix approaches based on your gear and current noise level!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SOLO MINIGAMES:

Depending on your approach, you'll face:

• Pattern Recognition - Memorize and repeat emoji sequences
• Reaction Speed - Press the correct button FAST (5 seconds!)
• Code Cracking - Solve math problems
• Lockpicking - Guess combinations using hints

Each minigame must be completed successfully to progress!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WINNING SOLO:

✅ Complete all 3 phases without detection
✅ Reach 100% progress each phase
✅ Pass all minigames

REWARDS:
• Full stolen amount goes to your guild bank
• You personally receive 10% of the stolen amount in your wallet
• Bragging rights!

================================================================================
                    👥 MULTIPLAYER HEIST GUIDE
================================================================================

STEP 1: LEADER SELECTS TEAM MEMBERS

1. Guild leader clicks "Multiplayer Heist"
2. A dropdown menu appears showing all guild members
3. Leader selects 1-4 additional members (2-5 total including leader)
4. Selected members are automatically included (no opt-out)
5. Click "Confirm Team & Proceed"

TEAM SIZE MATTERS:
• 2 players: Easier coordination, fewer bonuses
• 3-4 players: Balanced approach
• 5 players: Maximum bonuses, highest coordination challenge

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

STEP 2: ROLE ASSIGNMENT

The leader assigns one role to each team member:

👔 LEADER
   Task Type: Coordination and decision-making
   Specialty: Team management
   Minigame: Mental Math (calculations)
   Best For: The guild leader (reliable player)

💻 HACKER
   Task Type: Disable security systems and alarms
   Specialty: Technology and electronics
   Minigame: Code Cracking (math problems)
   Best For: Players good with numbers

💪 MUSCLE
   Task Type: Breaking vaults and forcing entry
   Specialty: Physical tasks
   Minigame: Lockpicking (combination guessing)
   Best For: Patient players who can solve puzzles

🚗 DRIVER
   Task Type: Plan escape routes and getaway
   Specialty: Quick reactions
   Minigame: Reaction Speed (button pressing)
   Best For: Players with fast reflexes

👁️ SCOUT
   Task Type: Monitor threats and guards
   Specialty: Observation and stealth
   Minigame: Pattern Recognition (memory)
   Best For: Detail-oriented players

IMPORTANT: Each role can only be assigned ONCE per heist!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

STEP 3: EXECUTE THE HEIST

Once roles are assigned and confirmed:

1. All team members see the heist interface
2. Each player has a "Complete Task" button
3. Tasks are role-specific for each phase

Example Phase Tasks:
• Leader: "Coordinate team movements"
• Hacker: "Bypass security cameras"
• Muscle: "Break through vault door"
• Driver: "Plan escape route"
• Scout: "Monitor guard patrols"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TEAM PROGRESS SYSTEM:

• Each player has individual progress (0-100%)
• All players see everyone's progress in real-time
• Phase completes when ALL members reach 100%
• Progress resets to 0% for the next phase

Visual Example:
   Phase 1: 🚪 Entry
   
   👔 @Leader (Leader): Coordinate movements ✅ 100%
   💻 @Hacker (Hacker): Bypass cameras 🔄 85%
   💪 @Muscle (Muscle): Force door ✅ 100%
   👁️ @Scout (Scout): Watch guards 🔄 60%

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

⚠️ CRITICAL RULE: ONE FAILS, ALL FAIL!

If ANY team member fails their minigame, the ENTIRE heist fails immediately!

This means:
• Everyone loses
• Everyone pays penalties
• High-stakes teamwork is essential
• Choose reliable team members
• Communication is key (outside the bot)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TEAM BONUSES:

When multiple players have heist gear equipped, bonuses stack at 60% 
effectiveness:

Example:
• Player 1 has +20% stealth gear
• Player 2 has +15% stealth gear
• Team stealth bonus = (20% × 0.6) + (15% × 0.6) = 21% total

Why 60%? Prevents overpowered combinations while still rewarding teamwork.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MULTIPLAYER MINIGAMES:

Each role has its own unique minigame:

👔 Leader: Mental Math - Solve calculations quickly
💻 Hacker: Code Cracking - Add numbers correctly
💪 Muscle: Lockpicking - Guess 3-digit combinations
🚗 Driver: Reaction Speed - Press correct button in 5 seconds!
👁️ Scout: Pattern Recognition - Memorize emoji patterns

All minigames must be completed successfully by each member in each phase!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WINNING MULTIPLAYER:

✅ All team members complete 3 phases
✅ Everyone passes all their minigames
✅ Team reaches 100% progress each phase

REWARDS:
• Full stolen amount goes to your guild bank
• Each team member receives: (stolen amount × 10%) ÷ team size
  Example: 10,000 stolen, 5 players = 10,000 × 0.1 ÷ 5 = 200 coins each
• Shared glory!

================================================================================
                      💰 REWARDS & PENALTIES
================================================================================

SUCCESS REWARDS:

GUILD BANK:
• Full stolen amount transferred to YOUR guild bank
• Can steal up to 75% of target's bank
• Higher amounts = higher risk

PERSONAL REWARDS:
• Solo: You receive 10% of stolen amount personally
• Multiplayer: 10% split equally among team
  Formula: (Stolen × 0.1) ÷ Team Size

Example Success:
   Target: EnemyGuild (Bank: 100,000)
   Amount: 50,000 (50%)
   Team: 4 players
   
   Results:
   ✅ EnemyGuild bank: -50,000 (now 50,000)
   ✅ Your guild bank: +50,000
   ✅ Each team member: +1,250 coins (50,000 × 0.1 ÷ 4)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FAILURE PENALTIES:

If your heist fails (detection or failed minigame):

PENALTY AMOUNT:
• You pay 30% of the amount you TRIED to steal
• Example: Tried to steal 20,000 → Pay 6,000 penalty

WHO PAYS:
• Solo: Full penalty from your wallet/bank
• Multiplayer: Penalty split equally among team

WHERE DOES IT GO:
• All penalties paid to the TARGET guild's bank
• They profit from your failed attempt!
• Serves as compensation and deterrent

Example Failure:
   Target: EnemyGuild
   Attempted: 20,000
   Team: 3 players
   
   Results:
   ❌ Heist failed!
   ❌ Total penalty: 6,000 (20,000 × 0.3)
   ❌ Each player pays: 2,000 (6,000 ÷ 3)
   ✅ EnemyGuild bank: +6,000

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DEBT SYSTEM:

If you can't afford the penalty, the remainder becomes DEBT:

• Debt tracked in your profile
• Auto-deducted from future earnings:
  - Daily rewards
  - Weekly rewards
  - Casino winnings
  - Any income source
• Shows in /balance command
• Must be paid off before keeping earnings

Example Debt:
   You owe: 5,000 penalty
   You have: 3,000 coins total
   Result: 2,000 debt created
   
   Next daily reward (500):
   - 500 goes to debt
   - Remaining debt: 1,500

================================================================================
                📅 SATURDAY GUILD CONTRIBUTIONS
================================================================================

An automatic system that prepares guilds for Sunday heists!

HOW IT WORKS:

Every Saturday at midnight UTC:
1. Bot calculates 75% of your total wealth (coins + bank balance)
2. Automatically deposits that amount to your guild bank
3. Locks withdrawals from guild bank until:
   • Sunday night ends, OR
   • Your guild is targeted by a heist

Example:
   You have: 10,000 coins + 40,000 bank = 50,000 total
   Saturday contribution: 37,500 (75%)
   Your remaining: 12,500
   Guild bank receives: 37,500

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHY THIS EXISTS:

• Forces guilds to pool resources for defense/attacks
• Creates high-value heist targets
• Prevents players from hiding wealth before Sunday
• Makes heist day more exciting and strategic
• Fair system for all guilds

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT HAPPENS IF TARGETED:

If another guild uses /heist against your guild:
• Withdrawal lock is removed immediately
• Guild can access funds even during Saturday/Sunday
• Compensation for being targeted
• Allows defensive spending

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

STRATEGIC TIPS:

• Save coins during the week for Saturday contributions
• Coordinate with guild for big Saturday deposits
• Your guild's total bank = heist target attractiveness
• Balance defense (low bank) vs offense (high bank for your heists)

================================================================================
                    💡 PRO TIPS & STRATEGIES
================================================================================

GENERAL TIPS:

1. Start Small: Practice with smaller steal amounts (10-30%) before 
   attempting big heists

2. Buy Gear First: Always invest in heist gear before attempting heists

3. Check Target Bank: Use /guild_info to scope out rich targets

4. Sunday Planning: Be ready at the start of Sunday to get first heist 
   attempt

5. One Shot: Remember, only one heist per guild per Sunday - make it count!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SOLO HEIST STRATEGIES:

APPROACH SELECTION:
• Early phases: Use Stealth to keep noise low
• Mid-phase: Can risk Fast if you have good gear
• Final phase: Stealth again for safe escape
• Tech: Good all-around if you have hacking gear

MINIGAME PREP:
• Pattern Recognition: Have pen/paper ready or screenshot
• Reaction Speed: Clear distractions, be ready to click fast
• Math Games: Use calculator if needed (no shame!)

NOISE MANAGEMENT:
• Track your noise level carefully
• If above 60-70%, switch to Stealth only
• Detection chance increases exponentially with noise
• Stealth gear is your best friend

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MULTIPLAYER STRATEGIES:

TEAM SELECTION:
• Choose reliable, active players
• Ensure everyone has heist gear
• Communicate plan before starting (Discord/DMs)
• Assign roles based on player strengths:
  - Good at math → Hacker/Leader
  - Fast reactions → Driver
  - Patient → Muscle/Scout

ROLE OPTIMIZATION:
• Easiest roles: Hacker (simple math), Scout (pattern matching)
• Hardest role: Driver (5-second time limit!)
• Consider giving hardest roles to most experienced players

TEAM COORDINATION:
• All members should be online and ready
• Have backup communication (Discord voice chat)
• Agree on minigame strategies beforehand
• Support struggling members with tips

GEAR DISTRIBUTION:
• Ideally, EVERY member has heist gear
• Focus on stealth and speed bonuses
• Smoke bombs for Driver role
• Coordinate purchases if guild bank allows

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TARGET SELECTION:

GOOD TARGETS:
✅ Guilds with 20,000+ in bank (post-Saturday)
✅ Guilds with few active members (weak defense)
✅ Guilds you've scouted beforehand

AVOID:
❌ Your own guild (not allowed)
❌ Guilds with under 10,000 (not worth penalty risk)
❌ Friendly guilds (politics matter!)

OPTIMAL STEAL AMOUNTS:
• Beginners: 25-35% of bank (easier difficulty)
• Experienced: 50% of bank (balanced risk/reward)
• Experts: 60-75% of bank (maximum profit, highest risk)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DEFENSE STRATEGY:

If you expect to be targeted:
• Keep guild bank lower (less attractive target)
• Have withdrawal locks trigger unlock (you can access funds after heist 
  attempt)
• Use freed funds to strengthen your members for revenge heist

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RISK MANAGEMENT:

BEFORE STARTING:
• Calculate worst-case scenario (30% penalty)
• Ensure you/team can afford failure
• Consider smaller heist if funds are tight
• Don't risk more than you can lose

DURING HEIST:
• Stay focused on minigames
• Don't rush - accuracy > speed (except Driver role!)
• Watch noise meter like a hawk
• If one phase is hard, next might be easier

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT:

• Start with solo heists to learn mechanics
• Try different approaches to find your style
• Learn from failures (check what went wrong)
• Study successful heists (what worked?)
• Build experience before attempting big multiplayer heists

================================================================================
